    <h1>Join me on my journey to becoming a developer.</h1>
    <p>My name is Matt Litchfield. By day, I am an electrical engineer designing power and lighting systems for retail and school construction projects, but by night I am a beginner programmer, collector and tech enthusist with a goal of becoming a software or web developer. When I am not playing prentend with my children or spending time with my wife, I can usually be found listening to a podcast, working on some hobby projects, or just relaxing playing a video game.

In my recent years of becoming a parent of two, I have learned two important lessons - it is important to have a work- life balance and to always being learning. I strive to apply these to my life everyday, whether making sure I allow time to make memories with my family or just taking some time to myself to unwind and maybe even learn some new skills with online classes.

Join me on my adventure of learning and discovery and, who knows, maybe we can both learn a new trick or two.</p>
